# Responsive SASS Boilerplate

This mobile first boilerplate can be run and compiled with middleman https://middlemanapp.com. Alternatively the */source* folder contains the static HTML. 

###Ruby Versions
Currently the best combination for this project is: 
+ Ruby Version: 2.0.0p647 (not the x64 bit as this has compatibility issues)
+ Development Kit: DevKit-mingw64-32-4.7.2-20130224-1151-sfx (not the x64 bit as this has compatibility issues)

Windows users see [rubyinstaller.org](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) for more details.

## Updates
+ 13.01.16 - Update to HTML, variables, removed and added mixins, prefixes and framework padding, see commit for more details
+ 12.05.15 - Update JQuery to 1.11.3
+ 10.02.15 - Added highDPI mixin  

## It includes...

**A basic grid framework based on the following width classes:**
 + wrapper-100 
 + wrapper-33 
 + wrapper-50
 + wrapper-25
 + wrapper-75
 + wrapper-66

**Note:** wrapper-container should be used as an immediate parent for all wrapper options except wrapper-100 e.g.

``` 
<div class="wrapper-container">
	<div class="wrapper-50">Content</div>
	<div class="wrapper-50">Content</div>
</div>
```

**The ability to add equal margins** to wrappers with the class *.with-margin* added to the .wrapper-container.

**Equal padding** using the *.padded-content* class inside of the wrapper class e.g.

``` 
<div class="wrapper-50">
	<div class="padded-content">
		<h2>Wrapper 50</h2>		
	</div>
</div>
```

**padded-content spacing variables** these are now set at the start of _framework.scss

**Horizontal padding** using the *.horizontal* class in conjunction with the .padded-content class

**Retina media queries** using the mixin *highDPI*. Note: this won't be compiled in the IE stylesheet.

## Browser Support
Tested in Chrome, Firefox, IE10, IE9*, IE8*, IE7*, IOS7 but am confident other major browsers will be supported. * There are some alternative options for these browsers (see below). 

### Media queries
Media queries are not supported in Internet Explorer 8 or below by default. When compiled a style sheet will be compiled *ie.css* that ommits the media queries used in your SASS files.
**Note:** This requires the user of the mixin *@mixin viewport($width)*.

Alternatively you can use a polyfill such as respond.js https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond  

### Mixins
I have updated the mixins to use the relevant prefixes as well as including the following:
+ flexBox()
+ flexOrder()
+ flexWrap()
+ flexAlign()
+ cssTransform()
+ cssGradient()


###Flexbox
Flexbox is not supported in Internet Explorer 9 or below. If you're wanting to use any of the flexbox classes such as *.with-equal-height* or *vert-align* make sure you include your ie.css in the following conditional statement:

``` 
<!--[if lte IE 9]>
```

Flexbox for < iOS7 requires child elements to have a property of *float:none* to display.
